# PublicOrdersReagentsColumn
Adds the Reagents Columns to Public Orders, so you can see if Reagents are provided for a public order without having to click into it.

If a profession has lots and lots of public orders, you will still need to click into the individual item. From there you can see whether each request has mats provided or not.
